Step 1: Set of models and their attributes
Step 2: Relationships that exist between models (1-1, 1-many, many-many)
Step 3: Translate into a database schema  (what tables, migrations, associations are needed)
Step 4: Generate the appropriate models and migrations
Step 5: Add associations to the models to inform them about the relationships


Step 1:

Models:

Customer
-email
-mailing address
-name

Order
-order number
-date


Step 2:
-1-many
cust -> orders

Step 3:

Customer:
-id
-email
-mailing address
-name

Order:
-id
-order_number
-date
-customer_id

Step 4:

rails generate model Customer email:string mailing_address:string name:string
rails generate model Order  order_number:integer date:date customer_id: integer

Step 5:

customer.rb
has_many :orders

orders.rb
belongs_to :customer
