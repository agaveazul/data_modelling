Step 1: Set of models and their attributes
Step 2: Relationships that exist between models (1-1, 1-many, many-many)
Step 3: Translate into a database schema  (what tables, migrations, associations are needed)
Step 4: Generate the appropriate models and migrations
Step 5: Add associations to the models to inform them about the relationships

Step 1: Model Attributes
Ingredients
-name

Recipes
-name

Recipes_Ingredients

Step 2: Relationship

many-many

Step 3:

Three tables: ingredients, recipes, recipes_ingredients

Step 4:

rails g model Ingredient name:string
rails g model Recipe name:string
rails g migration CreateIngredientRecipe recipe_id:integer ingredient_id: integer

#no need for a model for the join table as all information is stored in the other tables#

Step 5:

ingredient.rb
has_and_belongs_to_many

recipe.rb
has_and_belongs_to_many
